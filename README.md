# Multi-LLM Privacy Framework (MLPF)

A scalable and secure communication framework designed to facilitate privacy-aware interactions between multiple large language models (LLMs), ensuring sensitive data is handled responsibly and efficiently.

---

## Overview

Inspired by [Minions](https://github.com/HazyResearch/minions). The **Multi-LLM Privacy Framework (MLPF)** enables secure communication between LLMs of varying sizes, ensuring that sensitive data is processed only by trusted, smaller LLMs while allowing larger LLMs to perform complex tasks without direct access to private information. This framework is designed to scale seamlessly across multiple LLMs, making it ideal for applications requiring both privacy and collaboration.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-First Design**: Sensitive data is isolated and processed only by designated LLMs.  
- **Scalability**: Supports communication between multiple LLMs, from small (1.5B) to large (671B+).  
- **Secure Data Flow**: Encrypted communication channels ensure data integrity and confidentiality.  
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable to support new LLMs and use cases.  
- **Audit Logs**: Detailed logs for accountability and debugging.  
- **Error Handling**: Robust mechanisms to prevent data leaks and ensure reliability.

## Use Cases

- **Healthcare**: Process sensitive patient data with a small LLM while leveraging a large LLM for general insights.  
- **Finance**: Handle private financial information securely while using larger LLMs for market analysis.  
- **Customer Support**: Use small LLMs for sensitive customer interactions and large LLMs for generating detailed responses.  
- **Research**: Collaborate across multiple LLMs while maintaining data privacy.
